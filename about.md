Plottico's mission is to continuously make process monitoring simpler, less error-prone and more comprehensible by humans.

We do this by simplifying the interfaces and APIs to monitor your processes, giving you these starting options:

1. Directly plot any changing numbers on any website to a central dashboard using [plotti.co/dash](https://plotti.co/dash) service
2. Send data to plotti.co by executing simple GET requests of the form `https://plotti.co/YOUR_HASH?d=1.234` from bash, python, php or any other general method that can do http

this documentation site hosts a collection of API snippets in multiple programming languages that you can directly paste into your environment and get instant real-time monitoring running.
